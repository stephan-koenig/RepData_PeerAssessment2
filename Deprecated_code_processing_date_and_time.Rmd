### Date and Time

Some data in BGN\_TIME is formatted HHMM and contains two types of incorrect
entries that were corrected and then the entire column was stored as stormData$CORRECTED\_TIME:
(1) a single entry of "000" replaced with "0000";
(2) a large number of entries with the pattern "XX9X" (i.e. 9 at the ten-digit
minute position, X is any digit from 0-9) probably caused by a typo that were
replaced by "XX0X".

stormData$BGN_DATE contained HMS information that never changed ("0:00:00")
and HMS was removed and the processed data stored as stormData$CORRECTED\_DATE.
Then CORRECTED\_DATE, CORRECTED\_TIME, and TIME\_ZONE in stormData were used to
parse time and date as DATE\_TIME.


```{r fixTime}
replace90Min <- function(x) {
    # Function takes any 4 character long string and replaces any '9' at the
    # third position with '0'.
    if (nchar(x) == 4 & regexpr('[:digit:]{2}9[digit]', x) !=0) {
        paste0(substr(x, 1, 2), "0", substr(x, 4, 4))
    }
}
